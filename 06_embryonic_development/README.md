# Models Develop Like Embryos

## Research Hypothesis

All learning systems might go through universal developmental stages—like how all vertebrate embryos look similar early on. There are critical periods, differentiation phases, and a "body plan" established early.

## Significance

- Enables borrowing from developmental biology
- Predicts that interventions only work during certain windows
- Explains why some training choices are irreversible
- Provides developmental milestones for model training

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Developmental Stage Identification
Compare training trajectories across models:
- Identify invariant stages
- Measure stage transitions
- Detect developmental milestones

### Phase 2: Critical Period Analysis
Test for critical periods:
- Capability-specific windows
- Intervention timing effects
- Recovery potential after critical periods

### Phase 3: Cross-Architecture Comparison
Compare development across architectures:
- Universal vs. architecture-specific stages
- Scale effects on development
- Transfer of developmental insights
