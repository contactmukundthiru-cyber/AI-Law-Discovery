# Features Have Ecology

## Research Hypothesis

Inside neural networks, features aren't static vectors—they behave like species competing for representational resources. There are predator-prey dynamics, extinction events, invasive species, and ecological succession.

## Significance

- Provides new vocabulary and tools from ecology for understanding training
- Predicts phenomena like "representational collapse" when diversity drops
- Offers novel interventions based on ecological management
- Connects neural network dynamics to well-studied ecological systems

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Feature Tracking
Track features through training:
- Identify stable feature clusters
- Measure feature population dynamics
- Detect competition and cooperation patterns

### Phase 2: Ecological Analysis
Apply ecological frameworks:
- Species abundance distributions
- Predator-prey models (Lotka-Volterra)
- Carrying capacity estimation
- Extinction rate analysis

### Phase 3: Intervention Testing
Test ecological interventions:
- "Conservation" of endangered features
- "Invasive species" control
- "Habitat" (capacity) management
