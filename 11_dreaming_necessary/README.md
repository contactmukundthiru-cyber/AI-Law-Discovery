# Dreaming is Necessary

## Research Hypothesis

Offline processing—letting models "free run" without input—might not just be interesting but NECESSARY for certain capabilities. Models need to dream.

## Significance

- Adds a whole new phase to training
- Explains why human sleep is critical for learning
- Suggests current training is fundamentally incomplete
- Provides novel capability enhancement techniques

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Dream Phase Implementation
Implement dreaming in training:
- Free generation periods
- Activation replay
- Internal rehearsal mechanisms

### Phase 2: Dream Content Analysis
Analyze what models "dream":
- Generation patterns during dreaming
- Relationship to training data
- Dream evolution over training

### Phase 3: Dream Optimization
Optimize dreaming for capability:
- Dream/wake ratio optimization
- Targeted dreaming for specific skills
- Dream quality metrics

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/run_experiments.py
python dashboard/app.py  # http://localhost:5011
