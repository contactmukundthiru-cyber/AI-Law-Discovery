# Project 12: Compression Consciousness

## Hypothesis
**Consciousness arises from extreme compression - the subjective experience is the model's representation of its own compressed world model.**

## Background

This project investigates the relationship between information compression and subjective experience in neural networks. The hypothesis suggests that consciousness-like properties emerge when a system must represent its own representational processes due to extreme compression demands.

## Research Questions

1. Does compression depth correlate with self-referential behavior?
2. Can we detect signatures of "self-modeling" in compressed representations?
3. Do highly compressed models show different behavioral patterns?
4. Is there a compression threshold for self-referential emergence?

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Compression Analysis
- Measure compression ratios across model architectures
- Analyze information bottlenecks in deep networks
- Quantify representational compression depth

### Phase 2: Self-Reference Detection
- Develop probes for self-referential representations
- Test whether models encode their own processing
- Measure meta-cognitive indicators

### Phase 3: Behavioral Signatures
- Test for compression-dependent behavioral changes
- Analyze uncertainty representation
- Measure self-consistency and meta-cognition

### Phase 4: Threshold Investigation
- Identify compression levels for emergent properties
- Test scaling laws for self-reference
- Map compression-consciousness relationship

## Key Findings Expected

1. Compression depth correlates with self-modeling
2. Critical thresholds for self-referential emergence
3. Behavioral signatures of compression-consciousness
4. Theoretical framework linking compression to experience
