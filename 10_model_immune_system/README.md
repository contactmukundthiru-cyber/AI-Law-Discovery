# Models Have an Immune System

## Research Hypothesis

Robustness to adversarial inputs might emerge naturally—not explicitly trained. Models develop something like immune responses: recognizing "foreign" inputs, mounting "inflammatory" responses, developing "memory" of past attacks.

## Significance

- Suggests defense mechanisms we haven't noticed
- Connects AI robustness to immunology literature
- Provides new adversarial defense paradigms
- Explains emergent robustness phenomena

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Immune Response Detection
Identify immune-like behaviors:
- Activation patterns for adversarial inputs
- "Antibody" neurons for specific attacks
- Response adaptation over repeated attacks

### Phase 2: Immunological Modeling
Apply immunology frameworks:
- Innate vs. adaptive immunity
- Memory cell formation
- Autoimmune-like failures

### Phase 3: Immune System Enhancement
Develop immunity-based defenses:
- "Vaccination" procedures
- Immune system strengthening
- Autoimmune prevention
