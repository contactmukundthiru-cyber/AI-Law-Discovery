# There's a Maximum Intelligence

## Research Hypothesis

There exists a fundamental limit on intelligence—not compute-limited, but fundamentally limited. A ceiling no system of any kind can exceed, like the speed of light for velocity.

## Significance

- Defines the endgame for AI
- Tells us whether AGI is achievable and what its limits would be
- Informs resource allocation for AI research
- Provides theoretical grounding for capability limits

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Theoretical Framework
Develop theoretical limits:
- Computational irreducibility bounds
- Self-reference limitations
- Information-theoretic constraints
- "No system can model a system more complex than itself"

### Phase 2: Empirical Limit Detection
Search for empirical ceiling signatures:
- Diminishing returns analysis
- Capability ceiling detection
- Cross-architecture limit comparison

### Phase 3: Limit Characterization
Characterize the nature of limits:
- Task-specific vs. general limits
- Architecture dependence
- Relationship to complexity measures

## Quick Start
