# Cognition Has Weather

## Research Hypothesis

Inference in large models might have chaotic dynamics—sensitive dependence on initial conditions, unpredictable fluctuations, "storms" and "calm periods." Models have cognitive weather.

## Significance

- Explains output stochasticity beyond temperature sampling
- Suggests models have internal "moods"
- Connects to dynamical systems theory in neuroscience
- Provides new understanding of model reliability

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Chaotic Signature Detection
Probe activations during generation:
- Lyapunov exponent estimation
- Attractor identification
- Phase space analysis

### Phase 2: Weather Pattern Classification
Identify cognitive weather patterns:
- "High pressure" stable regions
- "Low pressure" unstable regions
- "Storm" detection during complex generation

### Phase 3: Weather Prediction
Develop forecasting for cognitive weather:
- Predict stability from early activations
- Identify weather-dependent failure modes
- Develop stabilization interventions
